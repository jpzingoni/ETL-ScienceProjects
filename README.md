# ETL Sciente Projects
The work covers scientific projects for Argentina available at 
'https://datos.gob.ar/dataset/mincyt-proyectos-ciencia-tecnologia-e-innovacion'. 
The goal was to utilize the available data to generate a report in Power BI encompassing all the information.

To achieve this, the following tools were used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Figma
- Power Bi

## Figma
I relied on the Figma tool to visualize relationships between different tables, 
making it a simpler way to work. Having the availability of all relationships from different tables makes it easier to generate changes.
