# ETL Science Projects
The work covers scientific projects for Argentina available at 
'https://datos.gob.ar/dataset/mincyt-proyectos-ciencia-tecnologia-e-innovacion'. 
The goal was to utilize the available data to generate a report in Power BI encompassing all the information.

To achieve this, the following tools were used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Figma
- Power Bi

## Figma
I relied on the Figma tool to visualize relationships between different tables, 
making it a simpler way to work. Having the availability of all relationships from different tables makes it easier to generate changes.

## Python
The work was done using Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment. Using the Pandas library, various files were manipulated to obtain the final results. The code can be referenced in the [`proyectos_cyt.ipynb`](proyectos_cyt.ipynb)
